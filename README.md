This repository contains a minimal Streamlit app (app.py) that can be run locally or deployed to platforms like Heroku or Streamlit Community Cloud.

How to run locally:

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended).
2. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the app:

   streamlit run app.py

Optional: Add secrets (for API keys) when deploying to Streamlit Cloud by adding an `OPENAI_API_KEY` value in the app's Secrets.
